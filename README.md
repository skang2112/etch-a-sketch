# Etch-A-Sketch

An in-browser Etch-A-Sketch project that will allow users to use their mouse to make pixelated drawings onto the screen-canvas. 

This project includes a slider to modify the pixelation of the grid, a Reset button to make the canvas blank, and two colour modes - classic blue and "psychedelic", which randomly changes the applied colour with every pixel hovered over. 

As a very javascript-heavy project, completing the code enabled me to dive deeper into DOM manipulation and experiment with different solutions to a single problem. Styling the GUI ended up taking the most time, however, which was a welcomed refresher into the workings of flexbox and other CSS fundamentals.
